abstract: Peptides are attractive for diagnostic and therapeutic applications
  due to their small molecular size, ease of synthesis and chemical
  modifications, high target affinity and specificity, efficient tissue
  penetration, and low immunogenicity. In the past decade, there has been
  enormous interest in the utilization of photofunctional transition metal
  complexes as cellular probes, bioimaging reagents, and therapeutic agents. The
  interest stems from the intriguing photophysical and photochemical properties
  of the complexes, including large Stokes’ shifts, long emission lifetimes,
  high photostability, and high singlet oxygen-photosensitization efficiency. In
  this Review, we summarize recent advances in the development of
  photofunctional transition metal−peptide conjugates for bioimaging and
  therapeutic applications, with a focus on the cellular uptake, intracellular
  localization, and (photo)cytotoxic activity of the conjugates. Our perspective
  on the current challenges and future development of photofunctional transition
  metal−peptide conjugates as diagnostic and therapeutic tools is also provided.
